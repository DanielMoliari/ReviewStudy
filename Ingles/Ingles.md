 -> Hi! Thank you for taking the time to meet with me
I'm grateful for the chance to discurss what I can bring to this company

Hi! It's nice to meet you. Please tell me about yourself.

-> I began my career in retail management, but I've always been drawn to marketing.
And by implementing a couple of new marketing strategies in my previous company, I was able to increase revenue by 39%.

Sounds great! Can you tell me about your weakness?

-> I sometimes find it hard to delegate responsibility. Sometimes it feels like I have to do everything by myself in order to come to the best result. But I'm working on this by setting up more meetings with the teams to make sure that everyone is on track and to make sure that I answer all of the questions, and set the right mood for everyone involved in the project.

Out of all candidates, why should we hire you?

-> Thank you for asking this question. I love what your company is doing, and I really like your previous marketing campaign. But I think you're missing out on targeted ads on Facebook and Instagram because I really see this is where you audience is. And a couple of your competitors have tried this technique, and I see it's working for them because they're doubling down on their budgets. So I was really thinking - what if we try to do the same but from a different angle that is more consistent with your branding strategy?
Anyways, if you hire me, I would love to test, a couple of ideas that I think will be able to help increase the revenue.

Hi, Marina, I am Sarah, head of marketing, nice to meet you!

-> It's nice to meet you too. Thank you for seeing me today!

Why don't you tell me a little bit abour your experience?

-> Great. Well, I just graduated from college last year with a degree in business.
I completed my internship during the last semester. I've learned so much there, and it really gave me a good feel for sales.

That sounds like a great program. What were your responsibilites?

-> I was mainly responsible for client satisfaction. I was constantly jumping on calls with them, and I was also responsible for generating reports about the satisfaction.
It really gave me this unique perspective of what a customer wants. And I got to know the company from the ground up.

It seems like you don't have too much experience in the field, which is fine, but what are some of the things you think you could bring to the table? 

-> As an employee, I want to be valuable for the company. And I also want to bring my unique experience to help the company grow. To start with, I consider myself a very fast learner. For example, when I was doing my intership, the company asked me to create a Youtube video for them. So I went on Youtube, resarched how you create a video, ad I started a video blog for them. I created the whole strategy

Great! How do you overcome any challenges you come across?

-> I honestly like challenges because they take you to the next level.

Well, Marina, that all sounds great! You will most likely hear back from us by the end of this week.

-> All right. Thanks for the opportunity, I'm really looking forward to connecting with you soon!

-> It's my pleasure, thanks so much for meeting with me.

-> It was great, we celebrted my Mom's birthday. How was your weekend?

Tell me a little bit about yourself.

-> I've been working at Smith, Inc. for 10 years as a manager.
Because of my time at Verizon, I have a lot of experience in providing customer service.

What attracted you to our company?

-> I was really impressed with yor commitment to renewable energy.
-> I was very excited to learn that you support your research department so strongly.

What would you say is your greatest strength?

-> My greatest strength is: flexibility
-> I find that this is very important when I: I'm working with lots of different people and opinions.

What is your greatest weakness?

-> My greatest weakness is:
-> It shows up in my work when:
-> The ways I've worked to improve in this area are:

-> My biggest weakness is public speaking. It's something that I've spent a lot of time working on and in which I've improved a great deal. I'm very comfortable in smaller meetings with my teams. But when I present an idea or concept to a larger audience, I still experience some stage fright. At this point, I can handle these situations professionally, but i would like to be more comfortable in these moments so I can really enjoy the experience of presenting, rather than just survive it.

Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

-> In 5 years, I would like to be ___.

-> As I mentioned before, I'm interested in growth. In five years I would like to be a part of a company growing its business on a regular and consistent basis. I'd like to be in a Vice President position with a focus on development. And while I know that would require much more public speaking, in five years I plan on being ready for it.

Do you have any questions for me?

-> Yes. Imagine you're looking back on this hiring decision in a year. The person you hired has exceeded your expectations. What did he or she do that impresse you the most?

-> That's helpful. It's good to know what the expectations are.

-> Can you tell me a little bit more about the team that I would be working with?

-> That makes sense. I really appreciate that you're considering me for the position.
I'd love to be a part of the company achieving its goals.

Sounds good, I look forward to it. Thanks again.
