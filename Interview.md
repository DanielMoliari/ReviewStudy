"I want to share that Iâ€™ve put in a significant amount of effort to prepare for this interview. Over the past weekend, I dedicated my time to studying and revisiting various concepts related to Docker and Kubernetes. I focused on understanding VM vs. containers, namespaces, cgroups, images, and clusters in Docker. For Kubernetes, I explored the necessary tools such as Container Runtime and Container Engine, and delved into the organization and logic of Kubernetes clusters, including the Control Plane, Workers, Kube Proxy, etcd, Scheduler, API Server, Controller Management, and so on. Additionally, I have practiced extensively to improve my communication skills for this interview. This opportunity is more than just a job for me; it's a dream that I am determined not to let slip away. I am truly excited about the possibility of contributing to your team and bringing my passion for DevOps to this role."
